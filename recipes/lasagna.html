 <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

 <ul>
    <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
    <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>

 </ul>

 <ol>
    <li><p>Step </p>
        Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes</li>
    <li><p>Step </p>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><p> Step </p>
        While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. </li>
    <li><p> Step </p>
        While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

    </li>
    <li> <P>Step </P>
        Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined</li>
    <li><P>Step </P>
        Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li><p>Step </p>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
    <li><P> Step </P>
        Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving. </li>
